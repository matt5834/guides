# 3-Note Chords

{% include callout.html content="**Important Concept** <br>Reinforce and remind students of the concept in Harmony Rule 1 that says letters **1 SKIP** apart are considered a consonance. We can build 3-note chords by simply stacking 3 letters on top of each other with each one being a skip **above** the one below it.   " type="info" %} 

This lesson begins with the idea that just as we have a sequence of notes to make a melody we can have a sequence of chords to create a chord progession. First however, we must explore how to build 3-note diatonice chords. 

## Diatonic Chords
Every chord in Music Works 2 will be considered a diatonic chord. 

## Determining the letters of a Chord
A main concept in this lesson is to help students determine what 3 letters make up a 3-note diatonic chord. We accomplish this by showing how all 3 letters must be able to be ordered from low to high in the musical alphabet while being separated by exactly 1 SKIP each.  For example, the letters CDE are not a 3-note diatonic chord in the key of C because there is no configuration of those letters where they could all be separated by 1 SKIP from low to high.  Only letters such as D F A can be ordered from low to high by SKIP. 


<h2><span class="label label-success">Classroom Activity</span></h2>

>Write a letter on a white board or overhead projector (for example E). Ask to students name a letter that would be one skip above it (G) and then write that stacked above the first letter. Then ask the class to name another letter that would be a skip above the middle note (B). Point out how this is a 3-note diatonic chord. 

## Naming Triads
Another way to help students determine what three letters make up a diatonic triad is to illustrate how we find the name of a chord. To determine the name of the diatonic triad that uses the letters C E A for example we first have to help kids put it into root position. 

{% include tip.html content="**Putting Chords Into Root Position** <br>We can help students put a 3-note chord into root position by having them re-arrange the order of letters until they are each exactly 1 SKIP apart from low to high in the musical alphabet with the lowest note at the bottom. The name of the chord will come the bottom note.      " %}


<h2><span class="label label-success">Classroom Activity</span></h2>

>Write three letters on a white board or overhead projector that all come from one diatonic triad but be place them not in root position. For example, B G E.  Ask the class to reorder the letters so they are in root position. If a student suggests G on the bottom, B in the middle and then E on top place those letters as such and point out how B works as the middle note because it is a SKIP above G **but then illustrate how E does not work as the top note because it is a LEAP above B.** Finally, place the notes in root position (E G B) and reveal how the chord is named after the E.
