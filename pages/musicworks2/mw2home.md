# Music Works 2 Teacher Guide!

Be certain that you go over the [Quick Start Guide][quickstart1] first for important technical information. 


## Philosophy
Music Works 2 builds on the concepts learned in Music Works 1 by exploring a deeper connection between melody and harmony. In essence, Music Works 2 expands a student's impression of consonance and dissonance to include chord tones and non-chord tones when creating a melody. 

## Course Flow

### Building Chords
We begin with a number of explorations to help students build 3-note, diatonic chords. Since the idea of SKIPS as a consonant interval was heavily featured in Music Works 1, students can use that concept to quickl build diatonic chords. 

### Chord Progressions
Similarly to the way students used a sequence of notes to build melodies in Music Works 1 they will now create a sequence of chords to create a chord progression.

### Melody and Chords
Students will add an original melody to their chord progression by using chord tones and non-chord tones.  A series of assignments will help them gain mastery over first determining chord tones and then using passing and neighbor notes. 

### Orchestration 
Having created most of the Form of their piece with 4 instruments - 3 for the harmony and one for the melody - students will then explore orchestrationg techniques. The most fun part of Music Works 2 is undoubtedly orchestrating the chord progression!

### Form etc.
Much of the way students develop the form or their piece and include performance practice markings is similar to Music Works 1.
