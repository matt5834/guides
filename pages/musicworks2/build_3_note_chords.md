# Build 3-Note Chord Assignemnt

This is a preliminary assignment that helps students simply notate each note of a given diatonic chord by placing one note in each of the three instruments. 

A common mistake is for the student to place all three notes in one staff. We want to help student see that they will be orchestrating their harmonies into as many as 6 instruments when they create their compositions.
