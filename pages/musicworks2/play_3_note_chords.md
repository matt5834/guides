# Play 3 Note Chords

## Using aQWERTYon
This lesson allows for students to quickly and easily make 3-note chords on the aQWERTYon instrument. Be sure that you have made all of the necessary setting changes on each student's computer for aQWERTYon to work properly. 

## Building From Bottom Row
Reinforce for students that they should build the chords from the bottom row of keys. They can simply then add a key above the bottom row in the next row up (slightly to the left) and then one more key in the row above to make the 3-note chord. Some students may want to use two hands and that is fine. 

## Other Techniques

There are certainly other ways to play 3-note chords and if a student finds a way that suits her this should be encouraged. 

## Other Instruments
If a student has piano or guitar skills encourage them to play 3-note chords on these instruments as well.
