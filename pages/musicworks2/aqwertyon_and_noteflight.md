## Helpful Note-Finding Tool
Some students may find aQWERTYOn to be a helpful tool for finding the letters that make up diatonic chords. 

## Helpful Note-Entry Tool
Some students may want to go a step further and use aQWERTYOn to enter notes direcetly into Noteflight.  Take note in the video directions of how aQWERTYon can be used to enter notes anywhere that a measure is selected in Noteflight. 

## Helpful Exploration Tool
aQWERTYon can also be an effective way for students to simply play chords and melodies to work on their ideas.... like a piano!  If a student wants to just play aQWERTYon without entering any notes in Noteflight they can do so as long as no measures are highlighted. aQWERTYon will play the sound of the last Noteflight instrument that was click.
