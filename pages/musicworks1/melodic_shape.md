## Steps, Skips and Leaps!
Students are going to begin composing even if they do not know music notation! This is the "sound before theory" idea.  **It's all about the musical alphabet!** We can talk about the way notes move from one to the next by simply introducing the musical alphabet:

### Steps = A,B,C...

### Skips = C,E,G,B,D...

### Leaps = G,C,F... (anything more than a Skip)

If our goal is to create a melody that is singable and memorable then we can say that most melodies like this have a *smooth melodic shape.* 

How do we make a melody with a smooth melodic shape?


Answer:  **Create a melodic shape where most of the notes move by step.**  

Can we prove this?  Yes! I'm sure you can think of some melodies to have your students sing and then look at the notes to see how they move mostly by step. "Twinkle Little Star" or  "Ode to Joy" for example. "Hey Jude" is a great melody that uses a fair amount of skips and leaps but still has mostly stepwise motion. 

## Melodic Direction
We can reinforce the idea of pitch going higher or lower in relation to the musical alphabet by pointing out that if the melody is going higher in pitch students can say the musical alphabet forward. If the pitch is going lower they can say the musical alphabet backward. For example, if we want a student to think of one note being below another I might ask them to say the alphabet backward to find it. 

## Make a Smooth Melodic Shape
We begin with letting students create a melodic shape by dragging notes up or down to create a melody that has a smooth melodic shape. 

## What's Happening Here?

Did you notice what **didn't** happen? 

There was was no discussion of (or exercises about) music theory whatsoever. There may come a time when a theoretical explanation is necessary but we believe that it shouldn't be at the beginning. Students can manipulate Noteflight to make the music sound the way they want. The feedback they receive about the choices they make will help them make future choices. 

Also there were no preliminary activities about how to use Noteflight. We've created the early lessons as a way for students to jump right in and have early successes. 

## Original Melodies

Students will compose an original melody that has a smooth melodic shape. Again, we want to reinforce that they can get a smooth melodic shape by using notes that move MOSTLY by STEP with ocassional skips and leaps. 


## What about Rhythm?:

We have not made any mention of rhythm so far! The idea that a melody needs to be singable can help students make choices that are also playable by instruments. (Important later on!) As an experienced musician you likely composed your melody while simultaneously conceiving of the rhythm you wanted. Most young students will gain rhythmic fluency by experimenting with different rhythms in Notelfight and hearing them back. 


{% include callout.html content="**Classroom Activity** <br>
Working in pairs using classroom instruments, iPads or band instruments students should compose and perform a short melody of 4 to 6 notes. The melody should use mostly steps. Student A and Student B can either play the same melody or create their own melody that they teach to each other. Melodies should be shared with the class. Before each class performance ask the entire class to listen for a smooth melodic shape. " type="primary" %}

### Using aQWERTYon
Obviously using aQWERTYon is a great way for students to explore different kinds of melodic motion. A great activity at the beginning or end of class would be to have students take turns playing a short melody while the rest of the class listened for the use of a smooth melodic shape. A guiding question would simply be: 

#### "Did Suzy use mostly notes that moved by Step?"
