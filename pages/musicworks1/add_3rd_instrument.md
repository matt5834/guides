## Three Instruments

Students should compose the majority of their piece with three instruments only. Even if they end up with a total of 6 instruments it might be best to compose only for 3 instruments so that they can keep track of the harmonic structure. 

{% include callout.html content="**Important Concept** <br>There is a simple way for students to go quickly from 2 instruments to 3 instruments.<br> 1. Be sure that the student has properly controlled all of the dissonances and have clear textures for her first two instruments. One of the instruments should be the clear *start* - the main melody.<br> 2. Students can copy and paste their background part into a third instrumnet. <br> 3. Often moving the entire third instrument UP or DOWN 1 skip will create a part that fits the with the melody and 2nd instrument very well. " type="info" %}
