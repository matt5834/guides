## Repetition
Repetition is perhaps the most important concept for the young composer to grasp. Think of your favorite song. Take note
the many ways that repetition is important to that piece. It could be small scale repetition like the way melodic phrases repeat or
it could be large scale repetition having to do with the overall form.

## Develop Your Main Melody- 3 Kinds of Repetition

Ok, now that you have a main melody that you really love I'm sure your listeners would like to hear it again. There are three ways you could develop your melody:


### Exact Repetition: 
Of course you could always just repeat it exactly as you have it. This is fine to do but it may be the least interesting option. 

### Variation:
Try repeating your melody but making some kind of change to it. Another way to think of this is having something new in your piece that is related in some way to something we've already heard. You could:


1. End on a different note the second time

2. Begin the melody differently the second time

3. Change the melodic shape slightly somewhere in your melody. 


### Sequence
A sequence is a kind of repetition also. Choose part of your main melody or even the entire melody. Repeat that exact same melodic shape but from a higher or lower starting note. For example:

A great warm up/beginning of class activity as students enter the classroom is to project the PlayPad app on the overhead projector or through a loud speaker. Perform the various kinds of repetition and ask students to identify what they are hearing." type="primary" %}
