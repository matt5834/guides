## Connecting Lines & Spaces to the Musical Alphabet

We want to spend little to no time teaching the the notes of the staff. Instead we want students to see the relationship between steps, skips and leaps and **lines and spaces.**

{% include callout.html content="**Using Lines and Spaces to Represent Distance** <br>Just as students use steps, skips and leaps with the musical alphabet they can use the lines and spaces of the staff to determine the distance between any two notes. " type="info" %} 



## Using the Alpha Keyboard

For students who may be new to reading notes on the staff remind them often about using the letters on the computer keyboard to enter notes. Pressing G will result in a G being placed on the staff, etc.
