## Focus on Texture

We find that **texture** is one of those open ended concepts that all learners can relate to. Before attempting to add a second instrument and through the process of combining parts it can be very useful for student to engage in examining texture. 

## Is The Main Melody Still the Star? 

{% include tip.html content="**What to Do When the 2nd Instrument Doesn't Work** <br>When a student adds their second instrument and it does not work will with the main melody we can focus on a series of questions concerning texture.     " %} 

 
{% include callout.html content="**Guiding Questions** <br><br> For students needing help after they've added a 2nd instrument:<br>




**1.  Does your main melody still sound like the star of your piece or is the new part covering it up somehow?**<br><br>
**2.  If the new part is working well with your main melody write about why you think that is so?**<br>
  - Are you using all consonant intervals?<br>
  - Does the rhythm of your new part leave space for your main melody?<br><br>

**3.  If your main melody is no longer shining through as the star of your piece because of your new part ask yourself if it is because of these reasons:**<br>
  - Do you have unresolved dissonances or do you leap to or from any dissonances?<br>
  - Is the rhythm of your new part somehow covering up or getting in the way of your main melody?

## It's About the Texture!

If the 2nd instrument uses consonant intervals and yet it still does not fit well with the student's main melody it is likely because of the rhythm. To keep a main melody prominent have the second instrument sound like a background part.  **Repetition** has a lot to do with making a part move into the background. As a rhythm repeats it frees up our brain to focus on other melodies. 

{% include tip.html content="<br>Ask your students to think of your favorite song with a drum beat. Notice how you can still hear the beat even though you're able to sing along with the melody.      " %}


Students will often need to revise their piece after creating their 2nd instrument. Students having difficulty should try using a repetitive rhythm!  A helpful technique for creating background parts is to use a regular pattern of rests. **Sometimes taking away notes and using rests can work better than adding notes!**

## Monophony, Homophony & Polyphony  
It can be helpful for students to know which texture they are trying to create as this will help them organize all of their instruments. The texture lesson covers <span class="label label-info">Monophony</span>, <span class="label label-info">Homophony</span> and <span class="label label-info">Polyphony</span>. The musical texture we used above, one that has a clear background part that supports a main melody, is  **homophonic texture.**  (There are two kinds of homophonic texture but we will focus on this one.)  The three main textures that we will be concerned with are:

* Homophonic Texture:  a clear background part that supports a main melody
* Monophonic Texture: a single melody played by one instrument or many
* Polyphonic Texture: more than one independent melody sounding at the same time


## Changing Textures for B Section
Switching between different textures will increase the complexity of the student's music.

<h2><span class="label label-success">Classroom Activity</span></h2>

>Working in pairs or small groups on classroom instruments, iPads, aQWERTyon or band instruments students will perform all three textures: **monophony, homophony and polyphony.**  Give students time to compose short examples of each and then perform them for the class. During the class performance ask students what texture they are hearing. 


Here is a group's example of homophony:
