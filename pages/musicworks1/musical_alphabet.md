# An Important Concept
The musical alphabet is a key concept for allowing all students regardless of prior experience to compose their music. We know that many students will rely on manipulating the musical alphabet to create their melodies as well as combining harmonies. Some students will take a long time reading notes on the staff. The musical alphabet allows for students to build their music and be creative while learning to read notes.
