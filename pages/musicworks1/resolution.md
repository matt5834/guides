## Harmony Must Serve the Main Melody

Before tackling the specific details of resolving dissonances it is important to put this concept into context for students. We do this first and formost by illustrating how harmony can support the students original main melody. 

{% include callout.html content="**Mostly Consonances** <br>Reinforce with your students that too many dissonances in background instruments can obscure the main melody making it hard for the listener to hear. Consonances fit with the melody note in a way that supports the melody.   " type="info" %} 

## Consonant Intervals Follow Dissonances

Dissonances are not bad. The important thing is to know how to control them. We suggest the following principle in order to help students resolve their dissonances in ways that demonstrate maximum control while still allowing for the important effect of tension and release. 

{% include tip.html content="**Consonance Always Follows Dissonance** <br>Anytime a dissonant interval is used - letters that are 1 STEP apart - always follow it with a consonant interval.     " %} 

## Experiencing Resolutions

The aQWERTYon practice lessons are a great way for students to practice combining two voices. Help students play both consonant intervals as well as dissonant intervals that resolve according to the principle above. 

{% include callout.html content="**Classroom Activity** <br>Working in pairs have students play short melodies on iPads, isntruments or with aQWERTYon. While student 1 plays a melody, student 2 should first try playing all consonant intervals. For other attempts student 2 can play a second part that has a dissonant interval resolving to a consonance. " type="default" %}
