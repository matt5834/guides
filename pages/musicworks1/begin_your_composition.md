## To Use aQWERTYon or Not?
Some students may want to use aQWERTYon to enter their melodies into Noteflight and some students may prefer to just use the mouse. Either way is fine!  The more important thing is that all students should try to play their melody using aQWERTYON, or another instrument, as a way to explore and create. 

{% include callout.html content="**Important Concept** <br>Once the melody is in Noteflight students should be encouraged to edit it and perhaps include ideas that they might not be able to play.  " type="info" %} 

{% include tip.html content="**Using Alpha Keyboard** <br>A great way for some students to enter their first melody will be to use the alpha keyboard on their computer. Suggest that students can press C to enter a C on the staff etc.      " %} 

## Length of Main Melody
A common error for many students is creating a melody that is too long. Students should make their main melody either 4 or 2 measures. Either length will allow them to manage their melody and use the various development techniques later on. 

## Reinforcing Singable and Memorable

### Singable
To this point not much attention has been paid to rhythm. Students should be encouraged to use a combination of quarter notes, eigth notes and sixteenth notes. For the student who uses thirty second notes or sixty fourth notes you can point out that these rhythms are usually not singable at a moderate to fast tempo. 

### Memorable
Of course we want students to creat a smooth melodic shape for their main melody. Remind students that they can acheive this by using notes that move mostly be step with ocassiona skips and leaps.

>The majority of learning happens when students listen to each others work during a classtime discussion. After students have completed this assignment either at home or during class time it is highly recommended that teachers choose a handful of pieces to display on a classroom projector or smartBoard. Often playing the student example followed by the question **Is Suzies main melody singable and memorable?** will be enough to facilitate a discussion from which all can learn. You may want to include the class in helping a student correct any errors.

## Creating a Safe Environment

{% include important.html content="**Creating a Safe Environment** <br>It is vitally important that teachers create a safe, comfortable environment in which kids can share and discuss their work. Point out that everyone is learning how to compose together and that by sharing work we all benefit.  Highlight the fact that students who share their work are being brave while making it clear that the classroom is a safe place to do so. Make it clear that a student's work need not be perfect in order to share.      " %}
