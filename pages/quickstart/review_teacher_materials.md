## Important Teacher Resources for Review
Since 2010 the YCIW curriculum has been honed and developed based on continually refining techniques and concepts. It is important for teachers to review the provided resources in order to plan for implementing the curriculum in a way that fits their teaching style and situation. 


### Course Teacher Guides
Every YCIW course has a teacher guide built in. Look for the link to the corresponding page in the Teacher Guide at the beginning of each lesson or assignment.
