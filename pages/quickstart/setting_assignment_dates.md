## Why Set Assignment Due Dates?
The only editing that the teacher must do in YCIW Classroom is to set the assignment due dates for each Module. We ask that teachers set the assignment due date for not only to help the students but also to keep the composer mentors update on the class's progress. 


## How to Set Assignment Due Dates
To add or edit an assignment date:

1.  Go to any Assignment in the course Module list and click Edit Assignment Settings.
	{% include image.html file="editAssignment.png" url="" alt="" max-width="175" caption="" %}
1.  Scroll down to the Assign window and enter your desired due date.
	{% include image.html file="setDate.png" url="" alt="" max-width="275" caption="" %}
1.  You and your students will now see the date displayed in the Module list.
	{% include image.html file="viewDate.png" url="" alt="" max-width="275" caption="" %}
