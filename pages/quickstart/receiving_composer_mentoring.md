You will find these assignment at the very bottom of the course modules list. 


## Utilizing Composer Comments

The composer mentor comments will always be upbeat in nature and highlight positive aspects of a student's piece. We encourage students to ask questions if they need help with a specific concept. We suggest that teachers use the comments as a way to both motivate students but also to reinforce the concepts in the curriculum.
