## Setting Up Notifications

It can be very useful to receive a notification email whenever a student submits an assignment. This is also one of several ways to track what assignments have been submitted.

### Enter Email Address
Go to the the Account Menu and select **Settings.**

{% include image.html file="notifications1.png" url="" alt="" caption="Step 1 - Go to Settings" max-width="250" %}


### Select Notifications
After you have entered your email address go to **Notifications** also located in the Account Menu.

{% include image.html file="notifications.png" url="" alt="" caption="Step 2 - Go to Notifications" max-width="550" %}

### Edit the Notification Type for Submissions
The most important notification setting to edit is that for Submissions. This will keep you informed any time a student submits work in YCIW Classroom. We recommend selecting the Daily Summary or Instant Notification.
